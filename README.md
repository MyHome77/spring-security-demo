# Spring Security

## Configuration

### Dependency
#### Spring boot
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
#### Without spring boot
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-config</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-security.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-web</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-security.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Change defaults from application.properties in spring boot
``` 
security.user.name=user
security.user.password=password
security.basic.authorize-mode=authenticated
security.basic.path=/**
```
* above enable basic authentication

### Basic java configuration
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
public class BasicSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {    
    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
            .inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user").password("password")
            .roles("USER_ADMIN")
            ;
    }
}
```
* change the global configuration
* disable basic auth config
* replace basic auth with default login form config (auto generated in this case bc default configure method in WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter)
* is possible to override auto generated form

### Url authorization

* Override method `configure` from `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`
* Difference btw use of Role and Authority in url authorization:
    *  hasRole("ADMIN") looks for `ROLE_` prefix authority (so it really checks for `ROLE_ADMIN` authority)
    *  hasAuthority("ADMIN") looks for ADMIN, so `Authority` API don't looks for prefix, is new and clean
* Url authorization goes from specific (delete) to general (anyRequest)
* If a user that try to access an URL secured and don't have authority then a 403 status code is send by API
```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/delete/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .formLogin()    // this is default login created by spring when no overriding configure method
    ;
}
```
#### Some types of authorizations
* hasAuthority: is the principal authority
* hasAnyRole: can have any role configured (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ROOT)
* hasAnyAuthority: can have any of authorities passed (ADMIN, ROOT)
* hasIpAddress: not very used in production, useful to be able to pinpoint a specific ip address
* access: allow the use of expressions
* authenticated: just need to be authenticated in order to use url, no special authority or privilege just authenticated
* anonymous: any type of access is ok for url
* denyAll: restrict any kind of access
* permitAll
* fullyAuthenticated, rememberMe: are tied 
* not: allow chaining 

### Custom login form page config
* Configured in method `configure` (overrid) of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`
* Default login form page is /login also the processing url page is /login
* Reason for not wanting to use the default configuration is that the defaults basically leak implementation details
* When using defaults other people can know about the framework and can exploit vulnerabilities if not patched
```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
       .authorizeRequests()
           //.antMatchers("/delete/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
           .anyRequest().authenticated()
       .and()
       .formLogin()    
           .loginPage("/login").permitAll() // login form page, exception to be available for people not logged in
           .loginProcessingUrl("/doLogin") // login proccesion url where authentication happens
       .and()
       .csrf().disable()
    ;
}
```
* Create login page (thymeleaf) and reference it with a controller
```java
@RequestMapping("/login")
public String list() {
    return "loginPage";
}
```

### Logout configuration
* Logout url default is /logout so it needs to change
* `.logout().logoutRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher("/doLogout", "GET"))` allow to be stricter and specify exact http method to do logout
* if CSRF is enabled, GET wonâ€™t work for logging out, only POST
* only POST must be used, since logout is an operation that changes the state of the system

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
  http
      .authorizeRequests()
          .anyRequest().authenticated()
      .and()
      .formLogin()
          .loginPage("/login").permitAll() // login form page, exception to be available for people not logged in
          .loginProcessingUrl("/doLogin") // login proccesing url where authentication happens
      .and()
      .logout()
          .permitAll().logoutUrl("/logout") // logout processing page
              //.clearAuthentication()
              //.deleteCookies()
              //.invalidateHttpSession()
              //.logoutSuccessHandler()
              //.logoutSuccessUrl()
      .and()
      .csrf().disable()
  ;
}
```

#### Other config that wraps logout
* clearAuthentication: is true by default, but can be turn it off. Typically, that's not something wanted, but there are production scenarios where you might need to make sure that you don't clear authentication when your user logs out
* deleteCookies: nice way to specify that when your user logs out, a list of custom cookies should be cleared. When using custom cookies that do need to be cleared on logout, this is the way to do it
* invalidateHttpSession: enabled by default, it's something that you can change if you have a scenario that requires you to not invalidate the session when your user logs out
* logoutSuccessUrl: when logged out, we were automatically redirected to the login page, with an extra logout parameter. You may want to have a custom logout page saying you have been logged out, and maybe presenting some extra information. So if you need the logout process to redirect to a different page, not the login page, this is the way to do it
* logoutSuccessHandler: to run extra logic when logged out. this is basically a way to hook into the logout process and run some custom logic. So for example, when you have other external systems that need to be aware when you're logging out
